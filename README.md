# hello-world
This repository is to test github

This is my first repository on GitHub, but not the first time I have used Git. Last year, I used GitLab, a Git environment provided by ANU, to submit an assignment. At the time, I felt that you could do a whole course on Git alone, so it was frustrating to only learn the system on a very shallow level. Now that I have some free time, I want to try and use it more often,particularly when creating my own projects and interacting with the code that others have advertised.

I don't know if I will continue to use GitHub now that I know I have to pay for private repositories, but I am continuing the tutorial so I better understand how to use Git software.
